    <!-- NOTE:
      - These are invisible on the page and are used to set the `clip-path` on the actual slices.
      - Original path points from Figma/editor are absolute, which fucks up responsiveness since it
        doesn't scale to the content being clipped. Converted to relative using a two step process
        using two different online tools, linked below:
        1. https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/
        2. https://yoksel.github.io/relative-clip-path/
      - First step is to paste in the path value into the first tool. Then, scale to 0.35 X & Y. Then
        convert to relative. This is now theoretically correct. Step 2 is for visually checking.
      - Second step is taking the modified path value from first tool and pasting into second tool's
        first field. This tool is finicky and I had to experiment with refreshing several times and
        toggling the 'Remove offset' button to get it to work. Once it cooperates, it will show the
        original followed by a version with its relative path tweaks. It provides the full <path> element
        for the SVG along with demo CSS/markup. Grab the <path> or just the path value from the 'All
        Together Now' section and use it in the final SVG markup. It should now be responsive. There
        are a couple of slices here that needed further manual positioning tweaks for the clipped
        images, for reasons unknown to me.
